MAD TRACKS LEVEL EDITOR PROGRESS
================================

GENERAL
---------

- defined new bpy type "MadMeshProperties" containing a material number
   to assign to each face of a mesh

- enabled Mad Tracks 3D view panel in object mode and import function


IMPORT
---------

- implemented .ldo import, good enough for now
	MAD TRACKS ENGINE ISSUE:
	Only one UV coordinate is assigned per vertex,
	instead of assigning a list of UV coordinates per polygon.
	So the vertex needs to be duplicated if it's shared by 2 polygons mapped to
	different regions of the texture.
	=> it doubles the vertex count for every model in the game
	=> it makes Blender's "Lightmap Pack" impossible to use, since it considers that UV-mapping
	is assigned per polygon and gives vertices multiple UV coordinates.
	Meaning I need to find another solution for .ldl file export!

- started implementing level .ini import, without trackparts
	ISSUES
	Rotation of some objects are wrong (might be because of Gimbal lock).
	MAD TRACKS FILE FORMAT ISSUE:
	Level .ini files do not seem to respect the file specification,
	as they contain duplicate sections and their order matter because of trackparts.
	=> it makes Python's configparser and other .ini readers impossible to use, since they
	consider that sections are unique and their order is irrelevant.
	Meaning I had to write a dedicated level .ini reader!

- started implementing a trackpart editor, in progress
	There are two distinct aspects: track building and track visualization.
	Having problems with visualization doesn't mean the track will have a problem in-game.
	It's because of the way trackpart sequences are stored, with only the first trackpart having coordinates.
	ISSUES
	Rotation of banked trackparts are wrong in Blender, meaning the next trackparts will also look wrong. It'll be fine in-game though.


TODO

- appending trackparts is really slow when importing levels, because we always work our way from the first trackpart instead of the second to last one

- are inverted trackparts also rotated properly when imported on their own?

- add an option to set trackpart sequence numbers and also use it when importing a level

- keep populating trackparts dictionary and editor trackparts, offsets are known by selecting the endpoint vertex and looking at the object's LOCAL location
>> try to support all the trackparts for Gravity Zero and import the level

- point out in the installation part of the repo that the madtracks_dir variable needs to be set
   to be able to import/export files.
   
   
EXPORT
---------

Not started yet. Kind of anticipated with object properties when importing.
I want to finish and refactor the level importer and trackpart editor beforehand.
